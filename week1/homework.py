my_list = ["abc","def","hij","klm","nop"]
my_int = 10

# Problem 1.
# Change this line so the addition expression evaluates to True

if my_int + 4 == 15:
    print("1. OK")
else:
    print("1. INCOMPLETE")

# Problem 2.
# Write a condition that evaluates whether or not "def" is in my_list
is_def_in_list = False

# write your solution after this line

# write your solution before this line

if is_def_in_list:
    print("2. OK")
else:
    print("2. INCOMPLETE")

# Problem 3.
# Create two different for loops that prints out each item in my_list, line by line.
#       - One for loop should print out items by looping through the list itself
#       - One for loop should print out items by looping through the length of the list
# (slides 15, 19, and 20 should be helpful)

# write your solution after this line

# write your solution before this line

# Problem 4.
# Add any two items to my_list so that the list has 7 items.

# write your solution after this line

# write your solution before this line

num_items = len(my_int)
if num_items == 7:
    print("4. OK")
elif num_items == 5:
    print("4. INCOMPLETE")
else:
    print("4. INCORRECT")

# Problem 5.
# Create a variable with any appropriate name that contains a list.
# Add it inside the parenthesis after the print to see what it looks like!

print()
